If you want to try out the full features of EaseUS Partition Master Professional Edition, you can download the trial version from the official website[^1^]. The trial version has all the functions of the Pro version except for some limitations such as not being able to change the cluster size and not being able to create WinPE bootable disks.
 
However, you can still activate the trial version with a serial key and enjoy the Pro version for free. In this article, we will show you how to get a valid serial key for EaseUS Partition Master Trial Edition and how to use it to activate the software.
 
## How to Get a Serial Key for EaseUS Partition Master Trial Edition
 
There are two ways to get a serial key for EaseUS Partition Master Trial Edition: one is to buy it from the official website or other authorized resellers, and the other is to get it from some giveaway websites or online sources.
 
The first way is more reliable and safe, as you will get a genuine and legal serial key that can be used for lifetime activation. The price of EaseUS Partition Master Professional Edition is $39.95 for a single license[^1^], which is quite affordable compared to other similar software. You can also get discounts or coupons from time to time on the official website or other platforms.
 
The second way is more risky and uncertain, as you may get a fake or invalid serial key that can cause problems such as activation failure, virus infection, data loss or legal issues. Some websites may claim to offer free serial keys for EaseUS Partition Master Trial Edition, but they may actually contain malware or adware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Some online sources may provide serial keys that have been used by others or have expired, which will not work for activation.
 
Therefore, we recommend you to choose the first way and buy a serial key from the official website or other trusted resellers. However, if you still want to try the second way, you should be careful and cautious about the sources you use and scan them with antivirus software before downloading or using them.

1. Download and install EaseUS Partition Master Trial Edition from the official website[^1^]. Do not update it to the latest version as it may invalidate your serial key.
2. Launch EaseUS Partition Master and click "Activate" on the right top pane. If you are using a Free edition, click the Upgrade button at the same location.
